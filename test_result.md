        comment: "🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIXED - INSCRIPTION BACKEND ISSUE RESOLVED (January 22, 2025): Identified and fixed critical bug causing 'compte introuvable' error after registration. PROBLEM: Two verify_password() functions in server.py - one using bcrypt (line 76) for members, one using SHA256 (line 935) for admin. Python was using the second definition, causing member login failures. SOLUTION: Renamed admin function to verify_admin_password() to eliminate conflict. VERIFICATION RESULTS: ✅ POST /api/members/register with French/Martinique data (Marie-Claire Dubois, +596123456789, MonMotDePasse2025!) - Registration successful with bcrypt password hashing ✅ POST /api/members/login with same credentials - Login now works immediately after registration ✅ Database verification - Member data properly stored in MongoDB with correct bcrypt hash ✅ Complete cycle inscription→connexion - 100% operational with realistic test data ✅ Token JWT generation and validation - Working correctly ✅ Password security - bcrypt hashing maintained, passwords not exposed in API responses. TESTING COMPLETED: 6/6 tests passed (100% success rate) with exact review request data.

    message: "🔧 CRITICAL INSCRIPTION BUG FIXED (January 22, 2025)! ✅ URGENT BACKEND ISSUE RESOLVED: Successfully identified and fixed the critical bug causing 'compte introuvable' error reported by user after registration.

Python was using the second definition, causing all member login attempts to fail with 'Email ou mot de passe incorrect' even with correct credentials. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Renamed admin function to verify_admin_password() to eliminate naming conflict, ensuring member authentication uses correct bcrypt verification. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: ✅ POST /api/members/register with exact review request data (Marie-Claire Dubois, +596123456789, MonMotDePasse2025!, FR nationality) - Registration successful with proper bcrypt password hashing ✅ POST /api/members/login with same credentials - Login now works immediately after registration (was failing with 401 before fix) ✅ MongoDB verification - Member data properly stored with correct bcrypt hash, password field excluded from API responses ✅ JWT token generation/validation - Working correctly for member authentication ✅ Complete inscription→connexion cycle - 100% operational with realistic French/Martinique test data ✅ Duplicate registration protection - Properly blocks attempts with existing email.
