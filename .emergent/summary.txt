The AI engineer's trajectory involved a dual focus: a major redesign of the admin dashboard to AllInclusive 2.0 and extensive data integrity corrections for villa listings. Initial efforts successfully integrated new admin HTML pages and navigation. Simultaneously, the AI battled persistent villa data issues, including incorrect counts, duplications, and a missing Espace Piscine villa. Key challenges involved removing hardcoded villa data in the backend's  that continually overwrote MongoDB, and addressing a rate-limiting issue causing Erreur de connexion. A critical turning point occurred when the user revealed they were accessing the frontend via GitHub Pages, which lacked a backend connection. This necessitated reverting the  to use static, embedded villa data instead of API calls, ensuring the public site's functionality on the given deployment environment.

<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform for 21 villas. Core features include reservation, search, and admin functionalities. Previous requirements covered Cloudinary video integration, robust security (JWT, Bcrypt, 2FA), WCAG 2.1 accessibility, site-wide responsiveness, and a secure member area. The current phase aimed for: enhanced security (authentication, 2FA, password policies, GDPR); improved UX (navigation, responsive design, graphical admin, real-time validation); WCAG 2.2 accessibility; technical robustness (state management, modularity); and performance/GDPR (caching, pagination, analytics). The most recent explicit request involved verifying existing villa information against , ensuring data consistency, accurate pricing, implementing an Information et tarifs section on all villa detail pages, and transitioning to a complete redesign of the admin dashboard (AllInclusive 2.0) with advanced management modules.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism), JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Chart.js).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (AsyncIOMotorClient).
-   **Security**: JWT, Bcrypt, PyOTP (2FA), Environment Variables.
-   **Data Handling**: JSON, CSV processing, dynamic/static HTML generation.
-   **Architecture**: JAMstack-like pattern.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a JAMstack-like architecture with a FastAPI backend (Python) primarily serving an API and static files, and a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend.



-   ****: The main entry point for the admin panel. It was initially the old admin dashboard.
    -   **Changes Made**: Completely replaced with the content of the new  to serve as the new AllInclusive 2.0 admin interface. This consolidates the admin entry point to the modern dashboard.
-   ****: The new, modernized admin dashboard featuring KPIs, graphs, and a responsive layout.
    -   **Changes Made**: Improved to display functional charts and intended to integrate with real backend data.
-   ****: The new advanced villa management module.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial structure and content for managing villas were added.
-   ****: The new advanced reservations management module.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial structure and content for managing reservations were added.
-   ****: The central FastAPI backend application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified the  Pydantic model to include . Crucially, hardcoded villa data and a  function that populated the database with old data were removed, ensuring that only MongoDB (after manual correction scripts) is the source of truth for villa data. The rate-limiting threshold was also temporarily increased.
-   ****: The main public-facing page displaying villas.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially modified to fetch villa data from  via  instead of using hardcoded JavaScript data (). Later, to accommodate the user's GitHub Pages deployment environment (which lacks a live backend), this was reverted. The  now includes a large JSON object directly in JavaScript () which is used to populate the villa cards, thus ensuring functionality without API calls. Duplicate JavaScript variable declarations causing errors were also resolved.
-   ** (NEW)**: A temporary Python script created to specifically address data inconsistencies.
    -   **Summary**: Used to delete erroneous villas, add the missing Espace Piscine Journée Bungalow, fix tariff duplications, and ensure the correct count of 21 villas in MongoDB. It was later modified for automated execution.
-   ** (NEW)**: A temporary Python script to correct a specific category.
    -   **Summary**: Used to change the category of Espace Piscine Journée Bungalow from piscine to fete.

-   Implement the Advanced Villa Management module (photo gallery, unified calendar, dynamic pricing, inventory).
-   Develop the Reservations Management module (visual pipeline, centralized communication, automated check-in/out).
-   Build the Analytics & Reporting module (custom dashboards, predictive analysis).
-   Address the persistent image server error (502).
-   Finalize full SEO-friendly URLs and PDF print functionality for villa detail pages.
-   Implement remaining Phase 4 member space functionalities (e.g., , external integrations).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical issue where the public  page was failing to load villa data due to the user deploying the frontend on GitHub Pages, which cannot access the local backend API.

The problem manifested as an Impossible de charger les villas error. Previous attempts involved:
1.  Ensuring backend data integrity: Cleaning MongoDB, ensuring 21 correct villas, fixing pricing, and categorizing Espace Piscine Journée Bungalow (from piscine to fete). This involved creating and executing  and , and crucially, removing hardcoded villa data and a problematic  function from  to make MongoDB the single source of truth.
2.  Updating  to fetch data from the backend API.
3.  Debugging JavaScript errors in  (e.g., duplicate variable declarations).
4.  Addressing backend rate-limiting issues that caused Erreur de connexion by temporarily increasing the rate limit in .

However, the core issue was revealed to be the deployment environment. To ensure the public  page functions on GitHub Pages (which serves only static files), the AI engineer reverted the data loading mechanism. Instead of an API call, the villa data (including the 21 correct villas, their updated prices, and the Espace Piscine Journée Bungalow in the fete category at 350€) is now **embedded directly as a JavaScript object () within **.

The current state is:
*   The public  page displays all 21 villas with correct data and pricing, functional on GitHub Pages.
*   The admin panel (now  redirecting to ) has been replaced with the new AllInclusive 2.0 interface, including dashboards, villa management, and reservation management sections.
*   Backend data in MongoDB is clean and consistent (21 villas, correct categories and pricing, no hardcoded data overwrites).

There is no immediate next step as the last task was fully concluded with instructions for the user to update their GitHub Pages.
