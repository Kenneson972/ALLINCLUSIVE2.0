The previous AI engineer's work evolved through distinct phases. Initially, the focus was on a total redesign of 21 villa detail pages, ensuring design consistency with 's glassmorphism, integrating CSV data, and fixing image display issues. This included refining text and gallery synchronization. Subsequently, a comprehensive admin dashboard was developed with a Node.js/Express backend, SQLite, and an HTML/JS frontend, featuring a unique code-based access system. Debugging for this admin page involved implementing an API proxy within the existing FastAPI backend to resolve connectivity. More recently, the engineer implemented a video section with autoplay for the Villa F3 Petit Macabou page, followed by a dynamic, real-time-data-driven interactive calendar on all reservation pages, adapting its design and functionality based on user feedback. The current trajectory concludes with the user requesting a comprehensive audit of the backend Python code.

The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform. Initially, the core problem addressed was data inconsistency, broken layouts, and duplicate content across 21 villa detail pages, requiring a 1:1 design replication from  with glassmorphism, data integration from , and image display fixes.
A new admin dashboard was required for villa owners for availability management via a unique 6-character code, integrating FullCalendar for real-time booking updates, limited villa management, and a Node.js/Express backend with SQLite.
Recent requirements focused on enhancing the Villa F3 sur Petit Macabou page by integrating a responsive video section (MP4/WebM, 16:9, custom controls, later changed to Cloudinary URL and autoplay on all devices). A key addition was an interactive booking calendar on , initially for F3 only, then extended to all villas. This calendar needed a specific 3-month (later 4-month, 2x2) multi-month display, a custom color legend (Libre/Occup√©/En attente), dynamic date selection, and integration with an external planning website () for real-time availability.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, ), JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Swiper.js, FullCalendar, AOS).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for main app and API proxy, Node.js/Express (JavaScript) for admin API.
-   **Data Management**: CSV, SQLite, Cloudinary for video hosting, external web scraping for calendar data.
-   **Architecture**: JAMstack-like; new admin module uses separate Node.js backend proxied via FastAPI.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a JAMstack-like architecture with a FastAPI (Python) backend, and static HTML/CSS/JS frontend. A new Node.js backend handles the admin panel.



-   ****: FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Serves API requests, static files, and acts as proxy for the Node.js admin backend.
    -   **Changes Made**:  modified for static images. New proxy routes () added for Node.js admin backend, solving CORS.  library added to . Currently undergoing an audit.
-   ****: Core villa detail pages (e.g., ).
    -   **Importance**: Displays individual villa information.
    -   **Changes Made**: Transformed to match 's glassmorphism, re-integrated data from CSV, updated image paths, fixed gallery JS, applied glassmorphism to info cards, enhanced text readability.  specifically received a video section integration, initially with a local MP4, then updated to a Cloudinary URL, and finally configured for autoplay on both desktop and mobile (with , , ,  attributes).
-   ****: Reservation page.
    -   **Importance**: Handles villa booking requests.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to recognize all 22 villas. A new interactive calendar was integrated, initially only for  via a conditional check, then extended to dynamically support all 21 villas. The calendar's design was updated from a 3-month to a 4-month (2x2) layout, and its availability data was connected to an external planning website ().
-   ** & **: Frontend for the new admin panel.
    -   **Importance**: Allows villa owners to manage properties.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch with glassmorphism design. JS handles unique code validation, renders villa details, initializes FullCalendar, and communicates with the admin backend via the FastAPI proxy.
-   ****: New Node.js backend for the admin panel.
    -   **Importance**: Provides API endpoints for admin functionalities (e.g., health, validate-code, login).
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains  (Express, sqlite3, dotenv, jsonwebtoken),  (API endpoints),  (initializes SQLite DB).
-   ****: Python script for FastAPI proxy routes.
    -   **Importance**: Proxies requests to the Node.js admin backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and integrated into  to resolve CORS/Mixed Content issues.
-   ****: New script created during calendar integration.
    -   **Importance**: Extracts real availability data from the external  website.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to parse and interpret availability status from the external site's image patterns (, ).

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the new Admin Dashboard (AllInclusive 2.0) deployment (postponed by user).
-   Implement Advanced Villa Management, Reservations Management, and Analytics & Reporting modules (postponed).
-   Finalize full SEO-friendly URLs and PDF print functionality.
-   Implement remaining Phase 4 member space functionalities.
-   **Current focus**: Audit Python backend code for sensitive variables, deployment scripts, JWT security, Swagger documentation, and Pytest implementation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the implementation of the video autoplay functionality for the Villa F3 Petit Macabou page (). This involved ensuring the video (hosted on Cloudinary) played automatically and looped, with specific optimizations for mobile devices (adding  and  attributes to facilitate inline playback on iOS and intelligent JavaScript to handle browser autoplay policies, providing a fallback to touch activation if autoplay is blocked). The visual overlay was hidden automatically, and controls were adapted for touch interactions on mobile.

Following this, the user provided a new, comprehensive request to audit the entire Python backend code located in the  directory. This audit involves several critical security, maintainability, and deployment-related tasks:
1.  **Sensitive Variable Management**: Relocating all sensitive variables (e.g., Stripe keys, database credentials, email configurations) into a  file and ensuring they are loaded securely using a  library.
2.  **Deployment Scripts**: Proposing a deployment script compatible with platforms like Railway or Heroku.
3.  **Authentication Security**: Verifying that all API routes requiring authentication utilize JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with a secure hashing algorithm, specifically .
4.  **API Documentation**: Ensuring that FastAPI's built-in Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation is fully active and accurately reflects all API endpoints.
5.  **Automated Testing**: Proposing Pytest unit tests for critical endpoints, such as reservation and payment.

The AI engineer's last actions were to begin this audit by listing files in the  directory and reading  and  to gather initial information for the audit.
