The AI engineer's trajectory involved enhancing a luxury villa rental app. Key phases included initial static content stabilization, detailed villa page generation, and significant mobile optimization, especially for . A major focus was establishing a comprehensive member space with login/registration, backend services, and UI integration. Critical security audits followed, addressing XSS, SQL injection, and weak password hashing (SHA-256 replaced by bcrypt). Persistent frontend display and navigation issues were resolved, including hamburger menu functionality and dynamic content updates. Most recently, the navigation structure was completely refactored to use dedicated HTML pages for main sections (e.g., Prestataires, Billetterie) instead of anchoring to , while maintaining the consistent glassmorphism design.

The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform offering 21 villas, reservations, and search functionalities. Initial needs included a static frontend, reservation system, Cloudinary video integration, and an admin panel. Recent requirements emphasized:
1.  **Security**: Implementing robust JWT authentication for the backend and a hybrid client-side solution for GitHub Pages.
2.  **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance through semantic HTML, ARIA, contrast, and touch-friendly elements.
3.  **Responsive Design**: Site-wide mobile optimization, including iOS video autoplay fixes.
4.  **UI/UX**: Resolving visual bugs, text clutter, and missing images for a professional appearance.
5.  **Villa Detail Pages**: Redesigning pages with interactive galleries, maps, SEO, and social sharing.
6.  **Reservation Page**: A modern, comprehensive page with dynamic pricing, validation, and multi-step forms.
7.  **Member Area**: Developing a secure, professional member space with registration, login, profile management, reservation history, loyalty program (Découvreur, Explorateur, Aventurier, Légende tiers), VIP functionalities (concierge), and notifications, all visually consistent with the main site. This includes dedicated pages (, , , , , , ).
Recent user requests included adding a Vous êtes du club? Se connecter link to the reservation page, fixing conflicts between login/dashboard, and modifying the main navigation to include SOS Dépannage while removing Compte and Fidélité tabs, ultimately transitioning main navigation sections to dedicated HTML pages.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in refactoring the main navigation of the KhanelConcept application. The user initially wanted to improve how navigation links behaved from the  page, specifically addressing that all links were redirecting to  and the hamburger menu was blocked.

The AI engineer fixed the hamburger menu on  by copying necessary JavaScript logic from , ensuring it opens, closes, and navigates correctly. It also enhanced the mobile menu design with more pronounced glassmorphism and smooth animations, applying these changes universally.

A key decision point arose regarding navigation: whether to keep all main sections (Prestataires, Billetterie, etc.) as internal anchors on  (Option 1, more smooth) or to create dedicated HTML pages for each (Option 2, more logical). The user explicitly chose Option 2, prioritizing logical URLs and potentially better SEO, despite potential slight loading delays compared to single-page navigation.

Following this, the AI engineer proceeded to implement Option 2:
1.  Created new HTML files for each main navigation section: , , , , and . Each new page was designed to maintain the exact visual interface (glassmorphism, video background, header) of the existing KhanelConcept application.
2.  Updated the navigation links in both  and  to point to these newly created, dedicated HTML pages (e.g.,  instead of ).

The last confirmed action was the successful creation of all dedicated HTML pages and the updating of navigation links across  and , with verification that clicking a link like Prestataires from the SOS page now correctly navigates to  while preserving the intended design and functionality. The problem Ca renvoi toujours à l’index has been addressed by creating separate pages.

The last task, creating dedicated HTML pages for navigation, has been completed and verified. No explicit next step was requested in the very last user message.
