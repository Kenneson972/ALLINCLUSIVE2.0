<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform. Key features include 21 villas, a reservation system, search functions, and an admin panel. Core requirements involved Cloudinary video integration, robust security (JWT, bcrypt, XSS), WCAG 2.1 accessibility, site-wide responsive design, and UI/UX improvements. A secure member area with registration, login, profile, reservation history, loyalty program, VIP concierge, and notifications was also a major feature. Recent updates focused on refining the search bar, mobile hamburger menu, and villa display animations. Latest requests include updating villa tariffs from catalogue images, reclassifying villas (Espace Piscine au François to journée, Studio Cocooning to normal), removing the spéciale category, and ensuring correct image and data mapping for all villas.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into refining the  villa listings. The focus was on correcting data mapping issues and ensuring the correct display of villa information and images. The AI engineer:
1.  **Resolved a syntax error** encountered during a previous test, allowing the frontend to load correctly.
2.  **Identified and fixed multiple image path mapping problems** within the  array in , ensuring that villas displayed the correct main images associated with their respective folders (e.g., , , , ).
3.  **Addressed data inconsistencies and duplications**:
    *   Removed a duplicate Bas Villa F3 Ste Luce entry by replacing it with Villa F3 Trenelle at the correct uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) and adjusting subsequent uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)s.
    *   Corrected the misnaming of , accurately renaming it to Villa F3 Le Robert and adjusting its category to séjour and adding €/nuit price unit. The previously introduced Espace Piscine au François as a separate entity was identified as an error and implicitly removed through these corrections.
