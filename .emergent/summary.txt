The AI engineer's work on the KhanelConcept luxury villa application involved an initial transition from static HTML to a React/FastAPI/MongoDB full-stack application. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested to maintain the existing  for GitHub Pages and focus on creating missing static pages like  and .

The core of the recent work focused on iteratively debugging and perfecting . This included resolving persistent infinite loading issues, JavaScript syntax errors (specifically with large JSON data), and critical file path mismatches (old  vs. new ). The engineer also systematically populated all villa data, images, and amenities, followed by a major architectural simplification by removing the unused  directory. The current focus is on ensuring all 21 villas display correctly with all their media and information.

The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform for Martinique. The initial goal was to transform a basic static HTML site into a sophisticated full-stack platform while maintaining its UI/UX. Key features developed include displaying 22 villas, integrating a reservation system, adding a Cloudinary video background, and implementing an intelligent search bar on the primary . An admin panel backend was developed, but its frontend remains a static .

Recent requirements emphasized enhancing the static site component:
1.  **Create and integrate  and :** These pages are crucial for displaying detailed villa information and handling reservations, linked from the main .
2.  **Populate :** Ensure all 21 (initially 22) villas have comprehensive, textual descriptions, accurate pricing, capacities, and amenities with emojis. Critically, each villa must display all its associated images from the  directory.
3.  **Add video background to :** Consistent with the main .
4.  **Resolve all navigation and data mapping issues:** Ensure clicking DÃ©tails from  correctly loads the corresponding villa on  without errors or incorrect data.
5.  **Simplify architecture:** Centralize static files at the  root by removing the redundant  directory and cleaning up .

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS), JavaScript (ES6+), Flatpickr, Cloudinary (for video background).
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB.
-   **Deployment/Hosting:** GitHub Pages (for static files), Supervisor (process management).
-   **Data Management:** JSON data structures for villa details, organized image directories.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application features a hybrid architecture. Originally, it involved a React.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. However, a significant part of the recent development has shifted focus to the static HTML component for GitHub Pages.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** FastAPI backend providing villa data and future admin functionalities.
    -   **Changes:** Contains comprehensive data for all 22 villas, serving as the source of truth for villa information used in the static pages.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** The main public-facing static HTML page. It lists villas and contains an intelligent search bar.
    -   **Changes:** The  JavaScript function was modified to correctly redirect to . The IDs of villas defined within its JavaScript array are the authoritative mapping for the entire static site.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Displays detailed information for individual villas. This file has been the focal point of recent development.
    -   **Changes:** Underwent extensive iterations:
        *   Initially copied from  to  to resolve loading issues (old bugged version in ).
        *   Modified to display detailed textual descriptions for 21 villas (based on 's 21 villas), including amenities with emojis and real prices.
        *   Integrated the Cloudinary video background from .
        *   **Major work involved debugging and fixing JavaScript syntax errors** caused by large JSON villa data and ensuring all 21 villas are correctly defined and loaded.
        *   **Crucially, all 21 villas now have their respective image galleries mapped and displayed correctly** from the  directory.
        *   The villa IDs within this file's JavaScript have been rigorously adjusted to match the IDs defined in  to ensure correct navigation and data display.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** A static page for reservation submission, linked from .
    -   **Changes:** Its latest functional version was ensured to be at  during the architecture simplification.
-   ** (and its contents)**:
    -   **Importance:** Previously housed the React frontend.
    -   **Changes:** This entire directory has been **deleted** to simplify the application's architecture and centralize all static HTML files at the  root, as per user request. This removed ambiguity regarding file serving locations (React dev server vs. static files).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Manages background processes (FastAPI backend, MongoDB, and formerly React frontend).
    -   **Changes:** Updated to remove the  section after the  directory was removed.

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop the Admin Panel: Implement features like secure login, villa management (CRUD), and reservation management.
-   Create the  page (deprioritized).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was intensely focused on resolving persistent loading issues and incorrect data display for villas on the  page, stemming from a combination of JSON syntax errors within the large villa data set and incorrect image paths.

The debugging and resolution process involved:
1.  **Isolating the JavaScript Bug (Chat 301-309):** After repeated Chargement... freezes, a simplified  was created with minimal villa data. This successfully loaded, pinpointing the issue to the large  data object in , likely a syntax error within its JSON structure.
2.  **Fixing JSON Syntax and Re-testing (Chat 310-313):** The JSON syntax within the  data in  was corrected. Testing with a small subset of villas (3) confirmed the core loading mechanism and display now worked perfectly, including the video background and all static data.
3.  **Correcting Image Paths (Chat 314-319):** The user noted images were still not displaying. The image paths within  were identified as incorrect and subsequently fixed (e.g., from relative to absolute ). Subsequent testing confirmed images now display correctly, showing the actual villa photos.
4.  **Populating All Villa Data and Images (Chat 320-Current):** With the core loading and image display issues resolved, the AI engineer began the process of systematically adding all 21 villas back into , ensuring each villa entry includes its complete, corrected data and all associated images from the  directory. This is an ongoing task to ensure every villa is fully represented.

The current state is that the  page loads correctly, displays villa data, and shows images. The engineer is now in the process of ensuring all 21 villas have their full, accurate data and all respective images integrated into the page's JavaScript data structure.
