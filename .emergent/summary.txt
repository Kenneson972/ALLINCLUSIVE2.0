The AI engineer's initial trajectory involved an iterative struggle to fix critical display and data consistency issues on existing villa detail pages, stemming from GitHub Pages deployment and persistent HTML corruption. This led to numerous Python scripts for radical HTML parsing and modification, often resulting in unintended content loss or design regressions, which the user explicitly described as niqué.

A significant pivot occurred when the user initiated a complete refonte totale (total redesign) of the villa detail pages. The AI engineer successfully transitioned to this new directive, systematically deleting old villa pages and recreating 21 new ones from a CSV dataset, adhering to a strict HTML template and design principles. The engineer then focused on synchronizing the main  with these new pages, ensuring correct navigation. The current phase involves implementing premium design enhancements, advanced photo galleries, and improved reservation integration across all newly generated villa pages, reflecting a clear shift from fixing existing broken content to building from a clean slate.

The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform for 21 villas in Martinique. The current phase aims for a total redesign of all villa detail pages. The core problem was data inconsistency, broken layouts, and duplicate sections on existing villa pages, exacerbated by a static hosting environment.

The user's explicit requests and the Refonte Totale mission include:
1.  **Preserve** the existing  interface, its glassmorphism design, and video background.
2.  **Delete** all previously existing villa detail pages.
3.  **Recreate** 21 new, standardized villa pages based *solely* on data from .
4.  **Maintain** a consistent glassmorphism design and video background across all new villa pages.
5.  **Standardized Template**: Each new villa page must follow a strict HTML template, accurately integrating CSV data for villa name, location, type, capacity, pricing (organized into a table), description, and amenities (as a bulleted list).
6.  **Photo Gallery**: Include a photo gallery section with a minimum of 6 photos per villa.
7.  **Booking Form**: Implement a villa-specific reservation form on each page, pre-filled with villa details when navigated from .
8.  **Reservation System**: Create/enhance  with a villa dropdown, availability calendar, automatic price calculation, and a unified contact form.
9.  **Premium Enhancements**: Implement smooth CSS animations, parallax effects, micro-interactions, progressive image loading, and smooth scrolling. Upgrade photo galleries to be high-quality sliders/carousels with thumbnails, lightbox, lazy loading, zoom on hover, and mobile touch navigation. Ensure video background is mandatory, optimized, with image fallback.
10. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize images (WebP), video compression, CSS minification, and JS loading.
11. **Final Audit**: Verify page load times (<3s), design consistency, functionality of links and forms, and mobile responsiveness.

The application architecture is a JAMstack-like setup with a FastAPI backend and a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend.



-   ****: The main public-facing page.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  function's mapping logic was updated to point to the newly generated  files, ensuring correct navigation from the homepage to the specific villa detail pages.
-   ****: FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Handles API requests, though the current focus is static site generation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Mentioned modifications like  and removal of hardcoded data, making MongoDB the source of truth.
-   ** (all villa detail pages)**: Individual villa pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: All previous 19  files were *deleted*. 21 new  files (e.g., , ) were created from scratch based on a standardized HTML template and populated with data from . These new pages incorporate the glassmorphism design, video background, and new premium design/gallery features.
-   ****: The reservation page.
    -   **Importance**: Centralized booking functionality.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct file modifications, but  was created to enhance its functionality, enabling pre-filling of forms via URL parameters. It also needs its links updated from the new villa pages.
-   ** & **: Retained as reference templates.

    -   **Importance**: Adds functionality to the reservation page for URL parameter parsing and form pre-filling.
-   **Python Scripts ( files)**: Numerous new scripts were created for automated tasks:
    -   : Audits the newly created villa pages.
    -   : Tests the loading performance of villa pages.
    -   : Verifies internal links between  and villa pages.
    -   : Final validation script for index-villa page synchronization.
    -   : Automates applying premium design enhancements to all 21 villa pages.
-   **Markdown Reports ( files)**: Generated for audit results and task completion.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into a complete refactoring and recreation of the KhanelConcept villa detail pages. The previous attempts to fix existing broken pages were deemed insufficient, leading to a user-mandated Refonte totale based on a CSV source of truth and a strict template.

The AI engineer has successfully accomplished the following:
1.  **Preparation**: Created necessary new asset directories and files:  and  for core design, and  for the background video.
2.  **Deletion & Recreation**: All 19 old  pages were systematically deleted. Subsequently, 21 new  pages were generated from scratch (e.g., , , ), strictly adhering to the provided HTML template and populated with data from .
3.  **Link Synchronization**: Corrected the  page's JavaScript mapping to ensure its Détails links correctly navigate to the newly created villa pages.
4.  **Auditing & Reporting**: Created and ran several Python scripts for auditing and testing (, , , ), confirming that all 21 new pages load, have correct links to the index and reservation pages, and maintain the glassmorphism design. Reports (, ) were generated.
5.  **Premium Enhancements (In Progress)**: The current focus is on implementing ultra-smooth design and premium features. The AI engineer has created new CSS () and JavaScript () files for this purpose. A script  was developed and executed to apply these enhancements to all 21 villa pages.
6.  **Reservation Integration (In Progress)**: To support URL parameters and pre-fill the booking form,  was created.

The very last action taken by the AI engineer was the creation of  (Chat Message 129), and the immediate next stated intent was to create a final test script to verify all these new improvements (Chat Message 130).
