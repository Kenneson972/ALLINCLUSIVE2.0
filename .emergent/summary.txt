The previous AI engineer meticulously refined the KhanelConcept luxury villa rental application from a functional MVP to a polished product. This involved extensive UI/UX fixes, comprehensive data clean-up, image gallery rationalization, information re-integration, pricing corrections, and critical mapping fixes for villa navigation. The current AI engineer then continued this work by performing a detailed security, UX, accessibility, and technical robustness audit, leading to a structured, phased implementation. Phase 1 focused on critical security (2FA, email validation), Phase 2 on WCAG 2.2 accessibility, and Phase 3 on UX/UI enhancements (graphical admin, real-time validation/notifications). Phase 4, currently underway, addresses performance and GDPR, initiating caching, pagination, and consent mechanisms. The trajectory demonstrates a systematic, iterative development process, directly responding to user feedback and progressively maturing the application.

<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform featuring 21 villas, a reservation system, search functionalities, and an admin panel. Core initial requirements included Cloudinary video integration, robust security (JWT, bcrypt, XSS), WCAG 2.1 accessibility, site-wide responsive design, and a secure member area with registration, login, profile, reservation history, loyalty program, VIP concierge, and notifications.

The previous AI engineer's immediate focus was on: villa data integrity (tariffs, classification, image/data mapping), gallery cleanup (removing information images), information restoration (re-integrating content as text), price accuracy, correcting villa mapping issues, and centering the hero logo.

Subsequently, the user tasked the current AI engineer with a comprehensive audit and implementation of a structured plan covering:
-   **Security & Compliance**: Authentication, sessions, password policies, anti-attack protections (CSRF/brute force), GDPR conformity.
-   **Ergonomics & UX**: Ease of use, clarity, intuitive navigation, error management, user feedback, responsive design.
-   **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 standards (keyboard navigation, contrasts, ARIA, screen reader compatibility).
-   **Technical Robustness**: State management, modularity, maintainability, testing, reusable components.
-   **Performance & RGPD**: Caching, pagination, GDPR consent, detailed analytics.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, Flexbox), JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Intersection Observer, Swiper.js, AOS.js).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (AsyncIOMotorClient).
