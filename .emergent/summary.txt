The trajectory details an extensive development process, initially focusing on critical frontend fixes and subsequently expanding into a major new feature: a comprehensive PHP admin panel. The first phase addressed user requests to refactor static HTML pages, specifically separating  into a category hub and  for listings, alongside persistent logo transparency issues. This phase involved multiple iterations, file corruption due to a tool error, and ultimately successful resolution of the logo, navigation, and  content.

The project then pivoted to building a robust PHP-based admin panel from scratch. This involved defining database schema, setting up core PHP architecture, and implementing key modules for villa management (listing, adding, modifying) and image handling (upload). The AI engineer successfully laid the foundations, created the necessary files, and built highly detailed and functional modules with advanced UX features like drag & drop image reordering, CSRF protection, and glassmorphism design. The current task involves integrating an HTML page generator within the  module and the dashboard.

The initial problem aimed to refactor a static HTML villa listing website.  was to become a category hub, while  would house existing villa listings. This involved removing the search bar from , replacing it with 7 category cards linking to static pages, and updating global navigation. Visual defects, notably an opaque logo on a fixed header and uncentered category grids, required fixes. Later, the  page and its links needed deletion, and  required restoration to display actual static villa pages without a search bar.

The project then expanded to create a full PHP-based admin panel. This panel requires a specific  directory structure, MySQL database integration (with , ,  tables), secure login/logout, CRUD operations for villas (list, add, modify, delete), advanced image management (multi-upload, gallery, reordering, main image), and a JSON API endpoint. The design must be modern with glassmorphism, responsive, and include a dashboard with statistics. The latest requirement is to integrate an automatic HTML page generator, using an existing static villa page as a template, replacing placeholders with dynamic data from the database, and saving the generated pages to . This generator needs to be accessible from  and the dashboard.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Glassmorphism), Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, Fetch API, SortableJS).
- **Backend (Existing)**: FastAPI (mostly untouched).
- **Admin Panel (New)**: PHP 8+, MySQL (PDO), PHP Sessions, Image Upload (GD extension).
- **Security**: CSRF tokens, sanitization, input validation, password hashing.
- **UX/UI**: Responsive design, Glassmorphism, AJAX, Toast notifications, Drag & Drop.

The application is a full-stack project. The frontend, primarily static HTML, CSS, and JS, resides in . The backend, a FastAPI application, is in . A new PHP admin panel is being developed in .



**Key Files and Modifications:**

*   ****: The main landing page, refactored to be a category hub. Original header/search removed, new fixed header and a category grid () added. Logo transparency fixed by removing an interfering JS script.
*   ****: Restored to display a list of static villa HTML pages after initial content issues. No search bar present, as per user's final clarification.
*   ****: Deleted. All references removed from navigation.
*   ****: Deleted. This script was found to be overriding the PNG logo with an SVG, causing transparency issues.
*   ****: New file containing SQL DDL for , , and  tables, including initial data for 21 villas and a default admin user.
*   ****: New file for database connection and constants.
*   ****: New file implementing session-based authentication and security.
*   ****: New file containing utility functions and PHP classes (e.g., , , ).
*   ****: New file defining the glassmorphism design for the admin panel.
*   ****: New file for interactive elements, AJAX handling, and UX enhancements in the admin panel.
*   **, , **: New files for admin authentication and dashboard functionality.
*   ****: New file for the JSON API endpoint serving villa data.
*   ****: New module providing a responsive table to list villas, with filters, pagination, and quick actions.
*   ****: New module for adding new villas via a comprehensive, validated form.
*   ****: New module for multi-image drag & drop uploads with previews and progress bars.
*   ****: New, highly complex module with tabs for villa information editing, integrated drag & drop image gallery management (reordering, set main, delete), and modification history. It includes advanced UX and security.
*   ****: Newly created file responsible for generating static HTML villa pages based on a template and database data. It is currently being integrated into .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a critical new feature: an **automatic HTML page generator** for villa pages. This involves creating a new PHP file, , which will take an existing static HTML villa page () as a template.

The  script is designed to:
1.  Fetch villa and image data from the MySQL database.
2.  Load the existing HTML template.
3.  Replace specified placeholders (, , , , etc.) with dynamic content.
4.  Generate HTML for equipment lists, image carousels, and thumbnails.
5.  Save the resulting static HTML file in the  directory with a slug-based filename (e.g., ).

The file  has been successfully created. The very next step in the trajectory involves integrating this generator's functionality into the  module (specifically, adding a üöÄ G√©n√©rer Page HTML button and its associated JavaScript logic) and potentially adding a üåê G√©n√©rer Toutes les Pages button to the dashboard.
