The AI engineer's work evolved from foundational application setup to comprehensive feature development and critical bug fixes. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the static content, particularly resolving GitHub Pages caching by hardcoding villa data in . A subsequent security and accessibility audit led to a significant refactor of the admin panel, introducing robust JWT authentication and a hybrid client-side solution for GitHub Pages. Following this, a major initiative was launched to generate and integrate detailed pages for all 21 villas, enhancing their structure, interactivity, and design consistency.

The recent phase heavily concentrated on refining the user experience, first by building a comprehensive reservation page and integrating it seamlessly. Subsequently, the focus shifted to extensive mobile optimization across the entire application. While many mobile UI/UX elements were successfully adapted, a persistent issue with the mobile header navigation on —where desktop navigation elements remain visible instead of the hamburger menu—has repeatedly surfaced and remains unresolved. The work has now transitioned to establishing a new member space, with the initial steps of creating login and registration pages completed.

The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform aiming to display 21 villas, manage reservations, and offer an intelligent search. Initial core requirements included a static  and , a reservation system, a Cloudinary video background, and an admin panel for CRUD operations with secure login. Persistent GitHub Pages display issues mandated hardcoding villa data in .

Recent demands, driven by an audit and further feature expansion, include:
1.  **Security:** Implement robust JWT authentication for the backend and a hybrid client-side method for GitHub Pages, eliminating exposed credentials.
2.  **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1):** Enhance semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, contrast, and touch-friendly button sizes.
3.  **Responsive Design:** Improve mobile adaptation, breakpoints, and ensure touch-friendly UI.
4.  **UI/UX:** Resolve text clutter, missing images, buggy graphs, and improve overall professional appearance.
5.  **Villa Detail Pages:** Complete redesign of 21 villa pages to include interactive galleries, detailed info, rich descriptions, maps, equipment lists, SEO-friendly URLs, breadcrumbs, social sharing, PDF print, and a favorites feature, all responsive and visually consistent.
6.  **Reservation Page:** Create a modern, comprehensive reservation page with dynamic pricing, form validation, additional services, multiple payment methods, and a multi-step mobile interface.
7.  **Mobile Optimization:** Enhance the entire site's mobile experience (layout, element sizing, typography, performance) while preserving the existing glassmorphism design and video background. Specific fixes for iOS video autoplay and mobile form elements were requested.
8.  **Member Area:** Develop a professional member space with secure registration, login, profile management, reservation history, a loyalty program, and VIP functionalities, maintaining visual consistency with the main site.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with optimizing the mobile version of the KhanelConcept site while preserving its existing visual identity. This involved a detailed audit and subsequent implementation of responsive design fixes, performance optimizations, and tactile interaction enhancements.

Significant progress was made in mobile optimization, particularly for the  page, which now features an optimized vertical layout, appropriately sized form fields, tactile buttons, and a dynamic summary. The calendars (Flatpickr) and guest dropdowns on the reservation page were also adapted for touch. Furthermore, iOS-specific issues for video background autoplay were addressed across the site (, , and all generated villa pages), ensuring videos start playing on the first touch interaction.

However, a persistent and critical issue remains: the desktop navigation links in the header of  are still visible on mobile devices, preventing the intended hamburger menu from functioning correctly. Multiple attempts to resolve this with CSS media queries and JavaScript manipulation have been unsuccessful, indicating a complex CSS specificity or order problem.

Despite this lingering issue, the user initiated a new, substantial task: creating a professional member space. The very last actions taken were the creation of the foundational  and  files for this new member area.
