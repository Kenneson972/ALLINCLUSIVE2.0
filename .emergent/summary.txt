The previous AI engineer meticulously developed and refined a luxury villa rental application from scratch, focusing on core functionalities, security, and mobile optimization. Initial work established static content, reservation flows, and an admin panel, followed by robust security implementations (JWT, bcrypt, XSS). A significant effort was dedicated to creating a comprehensive JWT-based member space across multiple HTML pages. The most recent trajectory reveals a deep focus on UI/UX fixes: persistent issues with the  search bar's positioning and display, the Voyageurs dropdown's functionality, and implementing scroll-triggered animations for villa listings. The engineer demonstrated iterative problem-solving, responding directly to user feedback, even reverting changes when initial fixes were unsatisfactory. The work concluded with a comprehensive site audit, confirming all recent visual and functional enhancements were successfully integrated and the site was deemed 100% fonctionnel.

<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform featuring 21 villas, reservations, and search functions, initially built with a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend and a FastAPI backend. Core requirements included a reservation system, Cloudinary video integration, and an admin panel. Recent critical requirements focused on robust security (JWT authentication, bcrypt, XSS), WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance, site-wide responsive design (including iOS video fixes), and UI/UX improvements (bug fixes, text clarity, image display). A significant feature was the development of a secure member area with registration, login, profile, reservation history, loyalty program (tiers), VIP concierge, and notifications, spread across multiple dedicated HTML pages. User feedback then guided navigation changes, adding an SOS Dépannage link, moving main sections (Prestataires, Billetterie) to dedicated HTML pages, and improving the Vous êtes du club? Se connecter prompt on the reservation page, along with continuous refinement of the search bar, mobile hamburger menu, and villa display animations.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed a series of persistent UI/UX issues on  and other pages.

1.  **Search Bar Positioning**: The user initially reported the search bar on  was incorrectly positioned and requested it be fixed without altering its Booking.com style. After several iterations and previous attempts (some reverted), the engineer successfully made all 5 fields (DESTINATION, ARRIVÉE, DÉPART, VOYAGEURS, BOUTON RECHERCHER) visible and correctly aligned on a single line by adjusting CSS (max-width, flex-wrap, padding, min-width) on .
2.  **Voyageurs Dropdown**: The user reported the Voyageurs dropdown was not displaying correctly, specifically appearing off-screen intermittently. The engineer fixed its positioning and ensured smooth opening/closing animations by adjusting CSS ( positioning, , , ) and JavaScript logic within , also ensuring it closes when clicking elsewhere.
3.  **Scroll Animations for Villas**: The user requested that the villa cards on  appear smoothly as they scroll down the page. The engineer implemented this using  in JavaScript and corresponding CSS for initial hidden states and fade-in/slide-up effects on .
4.  **Site Audit**: Finally, the user requested a complete audit of the entire site (all HTML pages) to identify areas for review. The AI engineer performed this audit and provided a detailed summary, confirming all previously identified UI issues (search bar, dropdown, scroll animations) were resolved and that the site was 100% fonctionnel.
