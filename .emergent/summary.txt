The AI engineer's trajectory involved a highly iterative and often challenging process of fixing and enhancing the KhanelConcept application. Initially, the focus was on resolving critical frontend issues, specifically the inability to display villa thumbnails due to a GitHub Pages deployment environment, which lacked a live backend connection. This led to a significant architectural decision: embedding villa data directly into  as a static JavaScript object.

Following this, the AI engaged in a prolonged battle against data inconsistencies and HTML structural issues within individual villa detail pages. The user repeatedly reported persistent problems, including duplicate Information et Tarifs sections, missing CSV data, inconsistent pricing, and broken visual layouts. The AI created numerous Python scripts for bulk HTML parsing and modification (e.g., , , , , ). Each fix often led to new or resurfacing issues, such as content disappearing (void pages) or the original elegant design being niqué (broken). This required repeated radical and ultra-radical cleanup and reconstruction attempts, often followed by restoring elements from an assumed 'main2' branch to recover the desired visual fidelity, while trying to preserve the corrected data. The trajectory concludes with the AI acknowledging its destructive actions and planning a restauration_complete_intelligente to merge the best of both worlds.

<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform managing 21 villas. Key features include reservation, search, and admin functionalities. Previous development phases established robust security (JWT, Bcrypt, 2FA), WCAG 2.1 accessibility, site-wide responsiveness, and a secure member area. The current phase aimed for: enhanced security (authentication, 2FA, password policies, GDPR), improved UX (navigation, responsive design, graphical admin, real-time validation), WCAG 2.2 accessibility, technical robustness (state management, modularity), and performance/GDPR (caching, pagination, analytics). The most recent explicit requests involved:
1.  Verifying existing villa information against  for data consistency and accurate pricing.
2.  Implementing an Information et tarifs section on all villa detail pages, initially consolidating information, then specifically merging Informations et Tarifs, Services inclus, and Informations importantes into a single, comprehensive section per villa, enriched with CSV data.
3.  Ensuring all villa thumbnails display correctly on the index page.
4.  Correcting issues with Détails links mapping to correct villa pages.
5.  Addressing visual inconsistencies and broken layouts on villa detail pages, ensuring text is within styled cards, and maintaining a professional, mobile-responsive design.
6.  Restoring any accidentally deleted content (e.g., photo galleries, ).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, inline styles), JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Chart.js).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (AsyncIOMotorClient).
-   **Security**: JWT, Bcrypt, PyOTP (2FA), Environment Variables.
-   **Data Handling**: JSON, CSV processing, dynamic/static HTML generation.
-   **Architecture**: JAMstack-like pattern for frontend; Python scripts for extensive HTML manipulation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a JAMstack-like architecture, separating a FastAPI backend from a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend.



-   ****: The main public-facing page.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially fetched data from . Reverted to use static, embedded  (large JSON object) directly in JavaScript for GitHub Pages compatibility. Image  attributes for villa thumbnails were updated from  to actual image paths (e.g., ). The  function's mapping logic was corrected to point to the correct  files.
-   ****: FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified  Pydantic model (). Hardcoded villa data and a  function populating old data were removed, making MongoDB the source of truth. Rate-limiting threshold temporarily increased.
-   ****: Main admin entry.
    -   **Changes Made**: Replaced with content from  for AllInclusive 2.0 interface.
-   ****, ****, ****: New admin modules.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial structures and content added.
-   ** (all villa detail pages)**: Individual villa pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: Underwent multiple cycles of modifications:
        -   Attempted and largely failed to remove duplicate Information et tarifs sections initially.
        -   Later, a comprehensive fusion was attempted to combine Informations et Tarifs, Services inclus, and Informations importantes into a single section, enriched with data from .
        -   Extensive radical and ultra-radical cleaning scripts (e.g., , ) were applied to remove persistent duplicate sections and ensure singular, correct price displays.
        -   HTML structures were reconstructed () to fix issues like orphaned divs and void pages, aiming for a consistent, mobile-responsive design with styled cards.
        -   Finally, an intelligent restoration () was initiated to bring back the  branch's original elegant structure while preserving the corrected pricing and information.
-   ****: This file was identified as containing the original, complete data (including galleries and detailed descriptions) that needed to be preserved or re-integrated into the individual villa pages.
-   ****: The source of truth for detailed villa data, including pricing, services, and important information. Used for enriching HTML pages.

The AI created numerous temporary Python scripts ( files listed above) throughout the process to perform automated HTML parsing, modification, and auditing tasks across multiple HTML files.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the new Admin Dashboard (AllInclusive 2.0) with all specified sections (Metrics & KPIs, Design System & Components).
-   Implement the Advanced Villa Management module (photo gallery, unified calendar, dynamic pricing, inventory).
-   Develop the Reservations Management module (visual pipeline, centralized communication, automated check-in/out).
-   Build the Analytics & Reporting module (custom dashboards, predictive analysis).
-   Address the persistent image server error (502).
-   Finalize full SEO-friendly URLs and PDF print functionality for villa detail pages.
-   Implement remaining Phase 4 member space functionalities (e.g., , external integrations).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was grappling with severe corruption of the villa detail pages, which the user described as niqué (screwed), with void content, broken photo galleries, and other design regressions. This was a direct result of the AI's previous radical cleanup and reconstruction scripts (e.g., , ) which, in an attempt to remove persistent duplications and fix layouts, inadvertently removed or corrupted essential content and the original design structure.

The user explicitly requested to revert to the  branch's structure while retaining the corrected pricing and information. The AI's current state is acknowledging the catastrophic failures of its previous attempts and planning a restauration_complete_intelligente (intelligent restoration). This plan aims to:
1.  Verify missing elements like  and photo galleries (which the AI confirmed  exists and  contains the original gallery data).
2.  Preserve the existing head and CSS of the pages.
3.  Retrieve the original, complete data (including photo galleries, descriptions, amenities) from a reference file like .
4.  Rebuild the individual villa HTML pages () using the desired  structure.
5.  Integrate the previously corrected and consistent pricing and information (from CSV) into this restored structure, ensuring no duplicates and maintaining the desired elegant glassmorphism design.

The very last action was the creation of the script  to execute this complex restoration and integration task.
