The AI engineer's work on KhanelConcept initially focused on completing performance and GDPR enhancements, including analytics and caching. A major iterative cycle then ensued to correctly integrate villa data from a CSV, where the AI repeatedly struggled with villa names and counts, introducing fictional entries and failing to display the tarification section accurately. Despite multiple backend successes, user feedback consistently highlighted these errors. The AI finally achieved correct integration of 21 real villas from the CSV, updating individual villa HTML pages with Information et tarifs section. This resolved the data consistency and display issues for villa details. Immediately after this success, the user shifted focus to a comprehensive redesign of the admin dashboard for AllInclusive 2.0, prompting the AI to begin creating new HTML files for admin sections.

<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform initially developed for 21 villas, featuring reservation, search, and admin functionalities. Early requirements included Cloudinary video integration, robust security (JWT, Bcrypt, XSS, 2FA, email validation), WCAG 2.1 accessibility, site-wide responsiveness, and a secure member area. The previous engineer also addressed data integrity, image/data mapping, and price accuracy. The current phase involved a multi-faceted improvement plan focusing on: enhanced security (authentication, 2FA, password policies, anti-attack, GDPR); improved ergonomics/UX (navigation, error management, responsive design, graphical admin, real-time validation/notifications); WCAG 2.2 accessibility; technical robustness (state management, modularity, testing); and performance/GDPR (caching, pagination, consent, detailed analytics). The most recent explicit request involved verifying existing villa information against a provided CSV, ensuring data consistency, accurate pricing, and specifically implementing an Information et tarifs section on all villa detail pages, then transitioning to a complete redesign of the admin dashboard with advanced management modules.

The application uses a JAMstack-like architecture with a FastAPI backend serving a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend.



-   ****: Central FastAPI application. Modified to include  in the  Pydantic model to support variable pricing. Also contains various API routes and database interactions.
-   ****: Stores environment variables. Updated with , , , , .
-   ****: Manages Python dependencies. Added , , , , , .
-   ****: Old graphical admin dashboard, now superseded by .
-   ****: Main public-facing page. Integrated new JavaScript modules (, , ).
-   ** (e.g., , , )**: New client-side JavaScript modules created for performance and GDPR compliance.
-   ** scripts (e.g., , )**: Numerous temporary Python scripts for database manipulation.  was used to clean the DB and integrate the 21 correct villas from CSV.  was used to iterate through all villa HTML pages, replace Tarification with Information et tarifs, and inject the correct CSV data, including .
-   ** files (e.g., , )**: Individual static HTML pages for each villa. These were extensively modified by  to display the Information et tarifs section with dynamically updated content from the CSV.
-   ** (NEW)**: Intended for the new admin dashboard with responsive layout, key metrics, and design system components.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a prolonged issue concerning the correct identification and integration of villa data from the  file. After several iterations where fictional villa names were introduced and the tarification section was not properly updated, the AI managed to:
1.  Clean the database and correctly integrate exactly 21 real villas from the CSV.
2.  Update the  Pydantic model in  to correctly handle .
3.  Develop and execute  to iterate through all 18 existing  pages. This script successfully replaced the Tarification section with Information et tarifs and injected comprehensive data (capacity, location, services, important info, detailed pricing grid) from the CSV into each page, maintaining the existing glassmorphism design.

Frontend verification via screenshots confirmed the correct display of the updated Information et tarifs section on individual villa pages (e.g., , ) and the correct count of 21 villas on the  page.

Following this successful data integration and frontend update, the user provided a new, comprehensive mission: a complete refactoring of the admin dashboard for AllInclusive 2.0. The AI has just started this new task by creating the initial HTML files for the new admin sections:
-   
-   
-   
The immediate next step is to update the admin navigation to include these new modules.
