The AI engineer's work transitioned from initial application setup to addressing critical security vulnerabilities and significant UI/UX improvements, culminating in a major refactor of villa detail pages. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the admin panel and ensuring consistent display of 21 villas, especially resolving GitHub Pages caching by hardcoding data in . A comprehensive audit report then shifted priorities, revealing severe accessibility, security (exposed credentials), performance, and responsive design flaws. The AI engineer successfully implemented a robust JWT-based authentication system for the admin panel, fixing exposed credentials and routing issues. This was followed by a crucial adaptation for GitHub Pages, creating a hybrid client-side authentication method. The latest major task involves a complete refactor of the 21 villa detail pages to meet extensive new requirements for structure, interactivity, SEO, and responsiveness, for which a generation script was initiated.

<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform. Core requirements include displaying 21 villas with details on  and , a reservation system, and a Cloudinary video background with intelligent search. A static admin panel () was needed for secure login (initial credentials: khanel, khanel-admin-2025), CRUD operations, image management (Base64), and -based sync. Persistent GitHub Pages issues required  to display all 21 villas consistently.

Recent work, driven by a detailed audit, mandated:
1.  **Security**: Eliminate exposed admin credentials, implement robust JWT authentication for backend and a hybrid client-side auth for GitHub Pages.
2.  **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)**: Fix color contrast, add alt attributes, ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation.
3.  **Responsive Design**: Improve mobile adaptation, implement breakpoints, ensure touch-friendly button sizes.
4.  **UI/UX**: Resolve text clutter, missing images, buggy dashboard graphs, and enhance overall professional appearance.
5.  **New Mission**: Rework villa detail pages ( originally), requiring a complete overhaul to include detailed header info, interactive photo galleries (8-12 photos), essential property facts, 200-300 word descriptions, map-integrated location details, categorized equipment lists, SEO-friendly URLs, breadcrumbs, social sharing, PDF print, and a favorites feature, all fully responsive with semantic HTML5, CSS Grid/Flexbox, vanilla JS, WebP images, and lazy loading.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, CSS Grid/Flexbox), JavaScript (ES6+, vanilla JS, Flatpickr, Chart.js), Cloudinary.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (AsyncIOMotorClient).
-   **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (static files, .nojekyll), Supervisor (process management).
-   **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens),  (for hybrid GitHub Pages auth).
-   **Image Handling**: Base64 encoding, WebP with fallbacks, lazy loading.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend served by a minimalist FastAPI backend, optimized for GitHub Pages.



**Key Files and Changes:**
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: FastAPI server, serves static files, handles API routes including authentication.
    *   **Changes**: Moved static file mounts to the end of the file to prevent API route interception. Implemented JWT authentication endpoints (, ) and helper functions (, , ). Defined  and  models for authentication data.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Main public-facing page.
    *   **Changes**: Reverted to hardcoded 21-villa data for reliable GitHub Pages display, bypassing  issues for initial load. Maintained UI and search/filter functionalities.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Admin login page.
    *   **Changes**: Removed hardcoded credentials, implemented JavaScript for API-based JWT authentication (local environment) and a client-side hybrid authentication (GitHub Pages). Enhanced for WCAG 2.1 accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA, labels, contrast, 44px buttons) and responsive design.  added to ensure proper event listener attachment.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Core admin dashboard.
    *   **Changes**: Integrated client-side JavaScript for JWT token validation upon load and token-based API calls. Added a logout button and UI elements to display the authentication status (e.g., Secured or GitHub Pages badge). Adapted to work with both local (JWT) and GitHub Pages (hybrid) authentication.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Process management for backend and frontend.
    *   **Changes**: The  service (React app) was removed from this configuration as the application shifted to a purely static HTML/JS frontend served directly by the backend/GitHub Pages, eliminating the need for a separate React development server.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: New documentation for the hybrid authentication system.
    *   **Changes**: Created to explain the universal credentials and how the login behaves differently on GitHub Pages (client-side) versus local (backend JWT).
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: New base template for generating all 21 villa detail pages.
    *   **Changes**: Created as a structured blueprint incorporating new requirements for image galleries, detailed information sections, location maps, equipment lists, and responsiveness.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: New Python script to automate the creation of 21 villa detail pages.
    *   **Changes**: Created to read villa data (implicitly from image directories and likely an internal data source) and generate individual HTML files based on .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on addressing critical security and architectural issues within the admin panel, then adapting the solution for GitHub Pages, and has now begun a complete overhaul of the villa detail pages.

The significant work accomplished includes:
1.  **Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes**: Eliminated hardcoded admin credentials in  and implemented a robust JWT-based authentication system in the FastAPI backend (). This involved fixing FastAPI routing issues where static file mounts were intercepting API requests, and ensuring the 's JavaScript correctly interacted with the new authentication endpoints.
2.  **Phase 2: Login HTML Update & Hybrid Authentication**: Enhanced  for WCAG 2.1 accessibility (semantic HTML5, ARIA attributes, improved contrast, minimum button sizes) and responsive design. Crucially, a **hybrid authentication system** was developed. This system intelligently detects if the application is running on GitHub Pages (static environment) or locally (with backend) and adapts its authentication method: client-side hashing for GitHub Pages, and JWT for local. This ensures the admin login functions correctly in both deployment scenarios, resolving a key user pain point.
3.  **Current Major Mission: Redesigning Villa Detail Pages**: The user explicitly requested a complete redesign of the 21 villa detail pages. This is a substantial task involving:
    *   Defining a new, comprehensive structure for each villa's page, including interactive photo galleries, detailed information (capacity, area, amenities), rich descriptions, interactive maps for location, and categorized equipment lists.
    *   Ensuring these pages are fully responsive, SEO-friendly, and include features like breadcrumbs, social sharing, PDF printing, and a favorites option.
    *   A  has been created as the base for this new design.
    *   The first individual villa page, , was successfully generated and tested, demonstrating the new design and interactive elements.
    *   A Python script, , has been created to automate the generation of the remaining 20 villa detail pages from existing image and information assets. The execution of this script was the very last action taken.
