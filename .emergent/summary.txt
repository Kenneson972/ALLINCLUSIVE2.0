The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the KhanelConcept luxury villa application. Initially, the engineer successfully transformed a static HTML site into a full-stack React + FastAPI + MongoDB application, implementing core features like villa display and a reservation system. A significant portion involved integrating a Cloudinary video background and developing an intelligent search bar within the existing  for GitHub Pages.

A critical pivot occurred when the user requested a complete multi-page static site structure, momentarily shifting focus away from the main . However, the user quickly corrected this, reiterating to maintain the existing  and focus on creating only the missing static pages, specifically  and .

The most recent intensive work involved iteratively debugging and perfecting . This included re-writing villa descriptions from image-based to text with strategic emojis, resolving JavaScript syntax errors, and fixing file path issues (the primary bug was an old, bugged  file in  being used instead of the newly corrected one in ). The engineer successfully moved the working version, ensuring instant loading for all 22 villas. The user's final instruction was to shift focus to the admin page, confirming the  issue was resolved.

<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform for Martinique. Initially a static HTML site, it aimed to overcome limitations in its photo galleries and reservation system to become a sophisticated, visually appealing rental platform.

**Implemented Features & Fulfilled Requirements:**
*   **Full-Stack Conversion:** Migrated to React.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, preserving original UI/UX.
*   **Villa Management:** Displays 22 villas (including Villa F6 Petit Macabou), with detailed villa pages.
*   **Reservation System:** Integrated a sophisticated reservation system (backend logic).
*   **Video Background:** Successfully integrated a looping Cloudinary video background.
*   **Admin Panel:** A secured admin dashboard for managing villas and reservations was developed (backend), but its frontend is currently a static .
*   **Intelligent Search Bar (Static HTML):** Implemented in  with location autocomplete, Flatpickr date pickers, and a detailed guest selector.
*   **Multi-page Static Site (Partial):**  and  have been created and integrated into the public-facing site for GitHub Pages.  now displays comprehensive textual descriptions and amenities with strategic emojis for all 22 villas, replacing previous image-based information.

**New, Pending Requirements:**
*   Develop the admin panel functionalities (login, villa/reservation management).
*   Create the  page (deprioritized for now).
*   (Original multi-page requirement included  which was later deemed redundant and , ,  are the main pending ones now).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS (Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Glassmorphism), JavaScript (ES6+), Flatpickr, Cloudinary.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB, Python-Jose (JWT).
-   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (static files), Netlify (full-stack, previously used).
-   **Tooling:** Supervisor (process management), Yarn.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application architecture is a hybrid: a full-stack React + FastAPI + MongoDB setup, alongside a significant static HTML component () primarily for GitHub Pages.



**Key Files and Changes:**
*   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    *   **Importance:** Core FastAPI backend. Manages villa data and potentially admin functionalities.
    *   **Changes:** Contains data for 22 villas. Villa F6 Petit Macabou details were added. Provides the source for villa information.
*   **/app/index.html**:
    *   **Importance:** The main public-facing static HTML page for GitHub Pages. It features an intelligent search bar and displays all villas.
    *   **Changes:** Revamped search bar (location autocomplete, Flatpickr, guest selector). The  JavaScript function was modified to correctly redirect to .
*   **/app/villa-details.html** (and its temporary location ):
    *   **Importance:** A newly created static page to display detailed information for individual villas, linked from .
    *   **Changes:** Underwent significant iterations:
        *   Initially, a placeholder was created.
        *   Modified to display detailed textual descriptions for all 22 villas, replacing image-based information.
        *   Emojis were added strategically for amenities.
        *   Extensive debugging was performed to resolve infinite loading issues, JavaScript syntax errors, and ensured correct data loading.
        *   The correct, working version from  was copied back to  to ensure the main link from  worked.
        *   Loading delays (setTimeout) were removed for instant display.
*   **/app/reservation.html**:
    *   **Importance:** A newly created static page for reservation submission, linked from .
    *   **Changes:** A basic template was created. The 's Réserver button was updated to link to this page.
*   **/app/villa-martinique/**:
    *   **Importance:** This directory was created as a starting point for a new multi-page static site architecture.
    *   **Changes:** Initial subdirectories (, ) and empty files (, , , ) were created. However, the development focus later shifted to modifying existing  and creating  and  directly in  or  instead of within this new structure. This directory's purpose is currently superseded by the direct additions to  and .
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop the Admin Panel: Implement features like secure login, villa management (CRUD), and reservation management.
-   Create the  page.
-   Further refine the multi-page static site structure, potentially migrating other parts of the application into this or linking to them coherently if the  and  structure is deemed final for static pages.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was intensely focused on resolving critical display and loading issues with the  page. The user repeatedly reported an infinite loading state or incorrect redirection when trying to access villa details.

The debugging process involved:
1.  **Revisiting JavaScript Syntax:** Identifying and fixing Unexpected token { and Unexpected token : errors in the  array and general script logic within .
2.  **Addressing Loading Delays:** Removing  calls that caused artificial delays and contributed to the perception of infinite loading.
3.  **Correcting File Placement and Access:** The core issue was discovered to be two  files: one in  (the older, bugged version) and a newer, functional version being developed and tested in . The link from  was pointing to the  version.
4.  **Consolidating Working Code:** The engineer successfully copied the perfected  from  over to , ensuring that the 's Détails button correctly linked to the functional page.
5.  **Data Consistency:** All 22 villas now have detailed, textual descriptions and appropriate emojis for amenities, replacing the old image-based information.

The  page now loads instantly, displays complete and accurate information for all 22 villas, has a consistent glassmorphism design, and correctly links to . The user explicitly confirmed the resolution of these issues, paving the way for the next phase.

<optional_next_step>
Concentrate on developing the admin page, starting with secure login functionality, as explicitly requested by the user.
