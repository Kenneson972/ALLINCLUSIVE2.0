The AI engineer's work involved an iterative, multi-phase development cycle, predominantly focusing on a total redesign (refonte totale) of the KhanelConcept villa detail pages. Initially, the AI attempted to fix existing corrupted pages, but shifted to a full recreation from a CSV source following user feedback. Key challenges included ensuring consistent design (glassmorphism, video backgrounds), accurate data integration, proper photo gallery display, correct inter-page navigation, and optimizing performance. The process was highly iterative, with the user providing critical, specific feedback after each major AI-reported completion, leading to deeper diagnostic work and subsequent fixes, culminating in comprehensive clean-up and a platform-wide audit.

The KhanelConcept application is a luxury villa rental platform for 21 villas in Martinique. The current phase aims for a total redesign of all villa detail pages. The core problem was data inconsistency, broken layouts, and duplicate sections on existing villa pages, exacerbated by a static hosting environment.

The user's explicit requests and the Refonte Totale mission include:
1.  **Preserve** the existing  interface, its glassmorphism design, and video background.
2.  **Delete** all previously existing villa detail pages.
3.  **Recreate** 21 new, standardized villa pages based *solely* on data from .
4.  **Maintain** a consistent glassmorphism design and video background across all new villa pages.
5.  **Standardized Template**: Each new villa page must follow a strict HTML template, accurately integrating CSV data for villa name, location, type, capacity, pricing (organized into a table), description, and amenities (as a bulleted list).
6.  **Photo Gallery**: Include a photo gallery section with a minimum of 6 photos per villa.
7.  **Booking Form**: Implement a villa-specific reservation form on each page, pre-filled with villa details when navigated from .
8.  **Reservation System**: Create/enhance  with a villa dropdown, availability calendar, automatic price calculation, and a unified contact form.
9.  **Premium Enhancements**: Implement smooth CSS animations, parallax effects, micro-interactions, progressive image loading, and smooth scrolling. Upgrade photo galleries to be high-quality sliders/carousels with thumbnails, lightbox, lazy loading, zoom on hover, and mobile touch navigation. Ensure video background is mandatory, optimized, with image fallback.
10. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize images (WebP), video compression, CSS minification, and JS loading.
11. **Final Audit**: Verify page load times (<3s), design consistency, functionality of links and forms, and mobile responsiveness.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, transitions, animations), JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Swiper.js for galleries, Intersection Observer, swipe gestures, lazy loading, Lightbox).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (AsyncIOMotorClient).
-   **Data Handling**: CSV parsing, dynamic HTML generation via Python scripts.
-   **Architecture**: JAMstack-like frontend with Python scripts for static site generation.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture is a JAMstack-like setup with a FastAPI backend and a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend.



-   ****: The main public-facing page.
    -   **Importance**: Entry point for users.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  function and internal mapping logic were repeatedly updated to point to the correct, newly generated  files. Optimized for click latency with visual feedback and reduced delays.
-   ****: FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Handles API requests, though the current focus is static site generation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Minimal direct changes in this trajectory, but backend testing ensured data integrity and API functionality for fetching villa data and managing reservations.
-   ** (all villa detail pages)**: Individual villa pages.
    -   **Importance**: Core content pages for each villa.
    -   **Changes Made**: All previously existing villa files were repeatedly *deleted* and *recreated* (multiple iterations due to user feedback). The final state involves 21 new  files generated from  using a standardized HTML template (similar to ). These pages now consistently incorporate the Cloudinary video background, an updated Swiper.js photo gallery with real images, logo in the header, and correct content display (fixed CSS/JS conflicts like AOS).
-   ****: The reservation page.
    -   **Importance**: Centralized booking functionality.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to remove the villa dropdown list. Now, it automatically pre-selects the villa when navigated from a specific villa page via URL parameters. Also updated to use the consistent Cloudinary video background.
-   ****: The primary source of truth for detailed villa data.
    -   **Importance**: Used to populate the content of all 21 newly generated villa pages.
-   ****: Directory containing real villa images.
    -   **Importance**: Source for populating photo galleries.
    -   **Changes Made**: Referenced and used extensively during villa page generation to ensure correct, high-quality images.
-   ****: New CSS file.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes the core glassmorphism design principles.
-   ****: New JS file.
    -   **Importance**: Contains JavaScript for overall glassmorphism interactions.
-   ****: New CSS file.
    -   **Importance**: Contains specific CSS for premium design enhancements, including image grid layout, responsive design, and critical fixes for content visibility ().
-   ****: New JS file.
    -   **Importance**: Handles premium gallery features (slider, lightbox, lazy loading, swipe gestures) based on Swiper.js.
-   ****: New JS file.
    -   **Importance**: Adds functionality to the reservation page for URL parameter parsing and form pre-filling.
-   **Python Scripts ( files)**: Numerous scripts were created and refined for automation, generation, and fixing:
    -   , , , , , , : For testing and auditing.
    -   , , , , , , , , , , , : For generating, updating, cleaning, and fixing various aspects of the HTML pages.
-   **Markdown Reports ( files)**: Generated for audit results and task completion, e.g., , , , , .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with performing a complete audit and correction of *all important pages* on the KhanelConcept platform, addressing lingering bugs and ensuring overall stability and cleanliness. This followed multiple iterations of fixing display issues, photo discrepancies, missing video backgrounds, and navigation errors on the villa detail pages, as well as refining the reservation page.

The AI engineer successfully initiated this task by creating and executing  (Chat Message 286, 288). The audit results were positive, indicating the platform is en très bon état with 1 erreur critique and some minor optimizations needed. The AI engineer then created  (Chat Message 290) to automate the identified corrections. The very last action in the trajectory was the creation of this correction script, and the engineer is poised to execute it. This aims to resolve any remaining minor issues or inefficiencies across the entire platform, moving beyond just the villa detail pages.
