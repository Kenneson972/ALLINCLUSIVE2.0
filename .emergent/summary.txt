The AI engineer successfully transitioned the KhanelConcept application from a static HTML site to a more dynamic, albeit still static-file-centric, solution for GitHub Pages. Initially, the focus was on perfecting  by resolving data duplication, mapping inconsistencies, and image path issues, ensuring all 21 villas displayed correctly with an interactive gallery. Subsequently, the engineer built a comprehensive admin panel from scratch, encompassing login, villa CRUD operations, image management, and data synchronization, all leveraging localStorage for persistence due to GitHub Pages constraints. The latest work involved integrating all 21 villas into the admin, adding image previews, and implementing a real-time (localStorage-based) synchronization mechanism to update the main site (, ) with changes made in the admin, which is currently being tested.

<product_requirements>
The KhanelConcept application aims to be a luxury villa rental platform. Initially a static HTML site, the goal was to evolve it into a full-stack application while preserving its UI/UX. Key requirements included:
1.  **Core Functionality**: Display 22 villas (later specified as 21 matching ), integrate a reservation system, add a Cloudinary video background, and implement an intelligent search bar on .
2.  **Static Page Development**: Create and integrate  and  for detailed villa views and reservations, linked from .
3.  ** Population**: Ensure all 21 villas have comprehensive textual descriptions, accurate pricing (from 850€ to 2200€/night for stay, 150€ to 250€/day for party), capacities, amenities with emojis, and display all associated images from .
4.  **Interactive Image Gallery**: Implement modal/lightbox and carousel functionality for images on .
5.  **Navigation & Data Mapping**: Resolve issues ensuring Détails clicks from  correctly load corresponding villa data on  without errors.
6.  **Architecture Simplification**: Centralize static files at  by removing the redundant  directory and updating .
7.  **Admin Panel Development ()**: Create a full-featured static admin dashboard with:
    *   **Dashboard**: Overview statistics.
    *   **Villa Management**: CRUD operations (add, edit, delete, duplicate) for villas with detailed forms (name, description, price, capacity, amenities, photos, etc.).
    *   **Image Management**: Multi-upload, drag&drop gallery organization, compression, smart naming.
    *   **Reservation Management**: Calendar view, status updates.
    *   **General Settings**.
    *   **User Interface**: Sidebar navigation, header, cards layout, modals, responsive tables, professional theme.
    *   **Technical**: LocalStorage for data, Base64 image conversion for GitHub Pages, JSON export/import.
    *   **Authentication**: Simple login page () with a password (later username khanel and password khanel-admin-2025).
    *   **Integration**: Discrete link from main site to admin panel.
    *   **Synchronization**: Implement a mechanism to update the main site (, ) with data changes made in the admin panel.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Bootstrap 5), JavaScript (ES6+), Flatpickr, Chart.js, Cloudinary (for video background).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (initial architecture, but current focus is static HTML).
-   **Deployment/Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static files), Supervisor (process management).
-   **Data Management**: JSON data structures (in JS files), localStorage/sessionStorage for client-side persistence, Base64 for image storage.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a hybrid architecture, initially with React/FastAPI/MongoDB. However, the current implementation heavily relies on static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, specifically for GitHub Pages deployment. The React frontend was completely removed.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides initial comprehensive data for all 22 villas.
    -   **Changes**: No recent changes were explicitly made to this file within the trajectory, as the focus shifted to static files and localStorage for the admin panel. Its data is the *source of truth* for villa information, but the *admin* now manages it via localStorage.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main public-facing page, lists villas, search bar.
    -   **Changes**:  was modified for  redirection. A discrete admin link (⚙️ icon) was added to the footer, and its visibility script was removed to make it always present. Crucially, it was modified to *read villa data from localStorage* via  for synchronisation with the admin panel.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays detailed information for individual villas.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent major cleanup to remove data duplication and match 's 21 villa IDs. All 21 villas now display correct textual descriptions, prices, amenities, and images. A full interactive image gallery (modal, carousel, thumbnails) was implemented. Like , it now *reads villa data from localStorage* for synchronisation.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Static page for reservation submission.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes within this trajectory.
-   ** (and its contents)**:
    -   **Importance**: Previously housed the React frontend.
    -   **Changes**: This entire directory was **deleted** to simplify the architecture.

    -   **Importance**: Manages background processes.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to remove the  section.
-   ** (new directory)**:
    -   **Importance**: Houses the entirely new static admin panel.
    -   **Changes**: Created with , , , , and subdirectories for CSS () and JavaScript (, , , , ). All these files were created and extensively populated to meet the detailed admin panel requirements.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Secure access point for the admin panel.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include a username field (pre-filled khanel) in addition to the password field (khanel-admin-2025). Authentication logic was adapted for both fields.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central control for the admin panel's UI and functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Major refactoring to properly initialize and integrate , , , and  classes. Includes logic for sidebar navigation and dashboard statistics.

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop the Admin Panel: Implement features like secure login (username/password now partially done), villa management (CRUD done), reservation management (pending), and general settings (partially done).
-   Create the  page.
-   Complete the population of all 21 villas in  with their correct data and all associated images (addressed, but final verification needed).
-   Fully implement and verify the frontend/backend synchronization for all data changes from the admin panel to the main site.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing and testing the comprehensive synchronization mechanism between the newly built admin panel and the main public-facing site ( and ).

The process involved:
1.  **Adding Sync Manager**: A new file, , was created to handle the logic of taking the villa data from the admin's  and updating the main site's  and  files to read from this .
2.  **Updating Main Site Pages**:  and  were modified to dynamically load villa data from  instead of hardcoded JavaScript arrays. This ensures that any changes made in the admin panel are reflected instantly on the live site upon synchronization.
3.  **Adding Sync UI**: A Sync Site button was added to the admin header () to manually trigger the data synchronization process.
4.  **Testing Synchronization**: The engineer initiated a test (Chat 241) by navigating to the admin panel and attempting to confirm if the synchronization button and the displayed villa data (21 villas, photos, prices) were correct. The observation confirms the admin interface is working, with the Sync Site button visible, and all villa data and photos displayed correctly.

The current state is that the admin panel is fully functional, capable of managing 21 villas with photos, and the synchronization mechanism has been implemented. The last step in the trajectory was initiating the final test to verify if the changes made in the admin (and synchronized via ) are indeed reflected on the main site.
