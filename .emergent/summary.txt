The previous AI engineer's trajectory involved two main phases. Initially, the focus was on a total redesign of 21 villa detail pages, addressing design consistency (1:1 replication from  with glassmorphism), data integration from CSV, and crucial image display fixes (server headers, GitHub Pages paths). This phase also included refining text and gallery synchronization. Subsequently, the engineer shifted to developing a comprehensive admin dashboard for villa owners. This involved creating a new Node.js/Express backend with SQLite, an HTML/JS frontend mirroring the glassmorphism design, and a unique code-based access system. The final part of the trajectory involved meticulously debugging connectivity issues for this new admin page, ultimately resolving them by implementing an API proxy within the existing FastAPI backend. The work concluded with the user deciding to pause deployment, indicating the current state of the application.

The KhanelConcept application aims to be a luxury villa rental platform. Initially, the core problem was data inconsistency, broken layouts, and duplicate content across 21 villa detail pages.
**Initial Villa Page Requirements & Status:**
1.  **Design Preservation:** Replicate 's glassmorphism and video background across all villa pages (Achieved).
2.  **Page Recreation:** Delete old and generate 21 new villa pages (Completed iteratively).
3.  **Data Source:** Use  for content, re-integrating data and images from  (Completed, including image path and server header corrections).
4.  **Content Standardisation:** Integrate villa name, location, type, capacity, pricing, description, amenities (Re-integrated).
5.  **Photo Gallery:** Minimum 6-photo gallery from , with fixed synchronization and simplified alt texts (Restored, fixed).
6.  **Premium Enhancements:** Smooth animations, glassmorphism, text/emoji enhancements, optimized text sizes for smoother design (Applied).
**New Admin Dashboard Requirements & Status:**
1.  **Autonomous HTML Page:** For villa owners to manage availabilities.
2.  **Unique Code Access:** 6-character alphanumeric code (e.g., JW29JP) for direct, exclusive villa access, without login. Code generated by main admin, expires (Implemented).
3.  **Interactive Calendar:** FullCalendar integration for date management (available/unavailable/blocked, notes), real-time sync via REST API (Implemented).
4.  **Limited Villa Management:** Access only to the associated villa's basic details, availability history, and recent reservations (Implemented).
5.  **Backend:** Node.js/Express with SQLite for API connection and code validation (Implemented).
6.  **Design Consistency:** Admin page interface must be 1:1 with  (glassmorphism) (Implemented).
7.  **Advanced Features:** Search/filter, notifications, CSV export, basic offline mode (Implemented).
8.  **Security:** CSRF protection, input validation, JWT for authentication, hashed unique codes (Implemented).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, ), JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Swiper.js, FullCalendar, AOS).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for main app and API proxy, Node.js/Express (JavaScript) for new admin API.
-   **Data Management**: CSV parsing (Python), SQLite (Node.js/Express), JWT for authentication.
-   **Architecture**: JAMstack-like for main app; new admin module uses a separate Node.js backend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a JAMstack-like architecture with a FastAPI (Python) backend serving static files and APIs, and a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend. A new Node.js backend has been introduced for the admin panel.



-   ****: Main public page, template for glassmorphism design.
-   ****: FastAPI backend. Important for serving API requests and static files.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified  to exclude static images from restrictive security headers. Later, new proxy routes () were added to forward requests to the Node.js admin backend, solving CORS and mixed content issues for the admin frontend.  library added to .
-   ****: Core villa detail pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: Transformed to match 's glassmorphism, re-integrated data from CSV, updated image paths (), fixed gallery JS (), applied glassmorphism to info cards, enhanced text readability and adjusted text sizes for smooth design.
-   ****: Primary data source for villa details.
-   ****: Contains villa images.
-   ****: Centralizes glassmorphism design.
-   ****: JavaScript for the reservation page.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to recognize all 22 villas correctly, updated  to ensure accurate villa ID mapping and consistent data display, removed debug numbers.
-   ****: New frontend page for villa owners.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch with 1:1 glassmorphism design from , includes video background, unique code input, and will house the interactive calendar.
-   ****: JavaScript for the admin frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Handles unique code validation, renders villa details, initializes FullCalendar, communicates with the admin backend via the FastAPI proxy. Debug logs added for diagnostics.
-   ****: New Node.js backend for the admin panel.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains  (Express, sqlite3, dotenv, jsonwebtoken),  (API endpoints for health, validate-code, login, validate-token),  (initializes SQLite DB with villa/code data from CSV), and  for configuration. Initially had port conflicts, fixed to run on 3002.
-   ****: Python script containing FastAPI routes to proxy requests to the Node.js admin backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and integrated into  to circumvent frontend CORS/Mixed Content issues when connecting to the separate Node.js server.
-   **Python Scripts ( files)**: Numerous scripts (e.g., , , ) were used iteratively for automation and fixes during the villa page redesign.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a connection error reported by the user for the newly developed admin proprietors page (). The admin page itself was initially declared 100% accomplie with its glassmorphism design, unique code access, and FullCalendar integration, backed by a new Node.js/SQLite backend running on port 3002.

However, the user reported that entering a code resulted in a connection error. Initial debugging confirmed the Node.js backend was running and its API () functioned correctly via direct tests. The issue was diagnosed as a browser-side problem, specifically related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) or Mixed Content, preventing the frontend (served from port 8080 by the main FastAPI app) from communicating directly with the Node.js backend on port 3002.

To resolve this, the AI engineer implemented a crucial architectural change: an **API proxy** within the existing **FastAPI backend ()**. New routes were added (e.g., , , , ) that forward requests from the frontend to the Node.js admin backend. The  Python library was added to , and  was updated to target these new proxy routes. After restarting the FastAPI server, the connection issue was resolved, and the admin page successfully authenticated and displayed villa data.

The work concluded with the user deciding to postpone the deployment of the admin page due to budget constraints and the architectural incompatibility with GitHub Pages (requiring a dedicated backend server), and requesting the deletion of related test files.
