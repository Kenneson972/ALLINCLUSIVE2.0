The previous AI engineer's work involved two main phases: first, addressing critical fixes on the villa reservation page, and then, a significant new feature development for an admin dashboard. Initially, the focus was on correcting data inconsistencies, broken layouts, and image display on individual villa pages, culminating in a 100% accomplished declaration. However, user feedback immediately triggered further debugging, revealing deep-seated issues with villa data mapping in JavaScript and an incomplete dataset. This led to iterative corrections on  and  files.

Subsequently, a major new feature was requested: a complete owner-admin page. This involved building a new Node.js backend with SQLite and integrating it with a custom HTML/JS frontend. Key challenges included setting up the new backend, database initialization, and persistent connection issues between the frontend and the new Node.js backend. The breakthrough involved implementing an API proxy within the existing FastAPI server to circumvent CORS and mixed content issues, allowing the frontend to connect securely. The admin page, featuring unique code access, an interactive calendar, and a glassmorphism design, was then deemed 100% functional before the user decided to defer its deployment due to hosting limitations.

2.  **Page Generation**: Delete old, generate 21 new villa pages. Status: Completed iteratively.
3.  **Data Source**: Use  for content, integrating data and images. Status: Data re-integration and image display fixed, including server security headers and GitHub Pages paths. Villa data mapping in  was refined to cover all 22 villas.
4.  **Content Template**: Standardized template for villa name, location, capacity, pricing, etc. Status: Re-integrated.
5.  **Photo Gallery**: Minimum 6-photo gallery. Status: Restored, synchronization fixed.

3.  **Backend**: New Node.js/Express with local SQLite. Status: Developed in .
4.  **Interactive Calendar**: FullCalendar integration for availability (available/reserved/blocked). Status: Integrated and functional.
5.  **Limited Villa Management**: Access only to owner's specific villa details and history. Status: Implemented.
6.  **Real-time Sync**: API integration (e.g., ). Status: API proxy created in FastAPI for Node.js backend, allowing communication.
7.  **Design Match**: Admin interface to match 's glassmorphism. Status: Successfully replicated.
8.  **Advanced Features**: Search, notifications, CSV export, basic offline mode. Status: Implemented.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism, Tailwind/Bootstrap), JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Swiper.js, FullCalendar.js, Axios/Fetch).
-   **Backend**: Python FastAPI (main API, static file serving, now acting as proxy), Node.js Express (new admin API).
-   **Data Handling**: CSV parsing (Python), SQLite (Node.js admin database).
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure admin access.
-   **Networking**: CORS, API Proxying, HTTP vs. HTTPS (Mixed Content).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a hybrid architecture: an existing FastAPI backend (Python) for core services and static file serving, and a newly introduced Node.js Express backend for admin functionalities. The frontend is primarily static HTML/CSS/JS.



-   ****: FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Serves as the main API and static file server. It also now acts as a proxy for the .
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Modified  to exclude static image files from restrictive headers (e.g., ) to fix image display issues on villa pages.
        -   **NEW**: Added proxy routes (e.g., , ) to forward requests to the new Node.js admin backend, resolving CORS/Mixed Content issues from the frontend.
-   ****: Python dependencies for FastAPI.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  to enable the FastAPI proxy to make HTTP requests to the Node.js backend.
-   ****: The reservation page.
    -   **Importance**: Displays villa details for booking.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated inline JavaScript to use the  object for dynamic content, fixing issues where villas were not recognized or had inconsistent data.
-   ****: JavaScript for the reservation page.
    -   **Importance**: Handles dynamic content loading for reservation forms.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Corrected the  mapping to include all 22 villas from the CSV, addressing initial issues where only 15 villas were recognized.
        -   Ensured proper mapping between URL parameters and villa data.
-   ****: CSS for villa pages and potentially shared styles.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added CSS rules to hide parasitic colored numbers (debug elements) on the reservation page.

    -   **Importance**: Handles the logic for unique code authentication, fetching villa-specific data, managing the FullCalendar, and interacting with the admin backend.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Implemented unique code validation and JWT handling.
        -   Integrated FullCalendar and its event listeners.
        -   **Crucial Change**: Updated API endpoint () to point to the FastAPI proxy routes () instead of directly to the Node.js server.
        -   Added debug logging for troubleshooting.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the new Admin Dashboard (AllInclusive 2.0) deployment process, specifically requiring a non-static hosting solution for the backend.
-   Implement the Advanced Villa Management module (part of admin dashboard, but more detailed features might be pending).
-   Develop the Reservations Management module (part of admin dashboard).
-   Build the Analytics & Reporting module (part of admin dashboard).
-   Finalize full SEO-friendly URLs and PDF print functionality (mentioned in original product requirements).
-   Implement remaining Phase 4 member space functionalities.
-   Review and potentially refactor the villa recognition system on the reservation page, as the automated test still showed discrepancies (though the immediate user reported problem was resolved manually).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical connection error reported by the user for the newly developed admin proprietors page (). Despite the AI engineer's prior declaration of MISSION 100% ACCOMPLIE, the user could not log in with their unique code.

The diagnostic process revealed that the new Node.js admin backend (running on ) was operational, and its API endpoints were working correctly when tested directly. However, the frontend (), served from  by the main FastAPI server, was experiencing issues connecting to the Node.js backend. The root cause was identified as a combination of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions and potential Mixed Content issues if the main site were to be served over HTTPS while the Node.js backend remained HTTP.

To resolve this, the AI engineer implemented a crucial architectural change: an **API proxy** within the existing FastAPI backend (). New FastAPI routes (e.g., , , , ) were added to . These routes now act as intermediaries, forwarding requests from the frontend to the Node.js admin backend. This required adding the  library to  for FastAPI to make outgoing HTTP requests. The  frontend was then updated to point its  to these new FastAPI proxy routes (e.g., ) instead of directly to .

After these changes, the connection issue was resolved, and the admin page successfully authenticated and displayed villa data. The user then indicated that the deployment of this admin page should be postponed due to its dependency on a running backend server, which is incompatible with static hosting like GitHub Pages. As a result, the AI engineer deleted temporary test files related to the admin page and acknowledged the deferral of the admin panel deployment.

<optional_next_step>
Wait for the user's explicit instructions on further improvements to the main site, as the admin panel deployment has been deferred.
