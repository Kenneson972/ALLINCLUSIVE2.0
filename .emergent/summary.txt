The AI engineer's trajectory began with maintaining an existing luxury villa rental application. Initial efforts focused on stabilizing static content, notably resolving GitHub Pages caching issues by hardcoding villa data and addressing security/accessibility through JWT authentication and a hybrid client-side solution. A major phase involved generating and integrating detailed pages for all 21 villas. Recently, the emphasis shifted to refining user experience, including developing a comprehensive reservation page and extensive mobile optimization. A persistent issue with the mobile header navigation on  (desktop nav visible instead of hamburger) has been noted as unresolved. The current work revolves around establishing a new, comprehensive member space, with foundational login/registration pages created and backend services for members completed and tested. The AI is now integrating member links into the main index page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in developing a comprehensive member space for the KhanelConcept application. This followed extensive mobile optimization efforts, which successfully adapted the  page and addressed iOS video autoplay issues site-wide. However, a critical unresolved issue persists where desktop navigation links appear on mobile for , overriding the hamburger menu.

The development of the member space began with the creation of  and . Following this, the AI engineer successfully completed and tested the entire backend for the member system (Phase 1). This includes robust JWT authentication for members, profile management, a loyalty system with four tiers (Découvreur, Explorateur, Aventurier, Légende), automatic point calculation based on reservations, intelligent notifications, and a wishlist system, all fully integrated with existing reservation data.

Upon user instruction, the AI engineer proceeded to create all the necessary frontend pages for Phases 2 and 3 of the member space plan, ensuring visual consistency with the existing design (glassmorphism, Cloudinary video background, blue palette). The newly created pages include , , , , , , , and .

The most recent work involved integrating member space access points into the  main page. This included adding Inscription and Connexion links to the header navigation. Furthermore, JavaScript logic was implemented to dynamically switch these links to a Dashboard link when a user is logged in. Current efforts are focused on adding CSS styles for a member profile preview element, indicating ongoing refinement of the  display for logged-in users.
